            <h2>I am a badass coding mama from Boston, learning responsive design. I became a Skillcrusher and started BIT when my first career was thrown a curve ball during the pandemic, and I embarked on a journey to satisfy my lifetime love of tech.

                Even before I first visited, Boston always seemed magical to me. I have to blame Laura Ingalls, for when she wanted to run away from home, Boston was where the train was going, and that had to be where freedom and independence waited...

                My passion: computers - I remember when the first Apple IIGS was brought into my elementary school. I would gaze into the computer lab, mouth agape, absolutely in awe! But it wasn't until I moved to Boston that there were enough computers around to bliss out to my heart's content!

                A fun fact: I giggled when I recently "learned" Git because it so closely resembled the UNIX commands I learned before I was introduced to the internet. The first webpage I ever viewed had photographs of Iceland.
